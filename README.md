# HOMEWORK: Intro to HTTP

Welcome to Unit 2!! Tonight's homework is pretty simple and has two parts: some reading and some questions.

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

### Part One

- Read the first two sections of [Chapter 17 of Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html) -- "The Protocol" and "Browsers and HTTP". (We'll talk about the rest of the sections in the chapter -- "XMLHttpRequest" and beyond -- later.)
- Answer the questions in [this markdown file](./questions.md) based on the reading and lectures.

### Part Two

- Follow the directions in [the JSON practice](./json-practice.md) markdown file.

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- An issue ticket created on the repo `ada-students` [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-ada/ada-students/issues/new)
- A link to your fork of this repository with the two filled-in markdown files
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM on MONDAY NIGHT!! ðŸš¨
